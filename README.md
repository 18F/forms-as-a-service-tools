## Tools

In this repository, there are many simple tools that aid in the development and testing of FormService functionality.  Following is a brief description of each tool along with execution instructions.

### ApiKeys

The ApiKeys tool is a simple webpage that allows the user to input a Form.io form definition path and displays the API Key names for the fields on each page of the form.

To run:
* Pull down the apiKeys directory
* Open the "ApiKeys.html" page in a browser
* Input the form definition path

That's it!
