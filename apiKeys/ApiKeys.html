    <h1>API Field Value Tester</h1>

    <p>The purpose of this page is to provide a webpage where each form page is displayed, 
      along with the API Key names of each of the fields on the page.  Note that this page 
      isn't very pretty, and doesn't have a bunch of error checking, but it was written as 
      a tool to help the form designers, developers, and testers.</p>

    <p>Some sample form API links are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>https://dev-portal.fs.gsa.gov/faas/mtwform</li>
      <li>https://dev-portal.fs.gsa.gov/faas/hud903</li>
    </ul>

    <section id="control-center">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Type the URL to the form json..." id="formJsonLink">
      <button id="get-btn">Get API Key names by Page</button>
    </section>
    <p></p>
    <div>Result: 
      <p></p>
      <div id="apiResult"></div>
